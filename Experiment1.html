The first counting <strike>device was used by the primitive people.</strike><b> They used sticks,</b> stones and bones as counting tools. As human mind and technology improved with <style="bgcolor:yellow" > <b style="background-color:yellow;">time more computing </b>devices were developed. Some of the popular computing devices starting with the first to recent ones are described below;
<b><u>Early computing machines</b></u>
<h1>1.Abacus</h1>
<h2>2.Napier's Bones</h2>
<h3>3.Slide Rule by William Oughtred</h3>
<h4>4.Pascaline</h4>
<h5>5.Stepped Reckoner or Leibnitz wheel</h5>
<h6>6.Analytical Engine</h6>
<b>Example:</b>
<P>The next major changes in the history of computer began in 1937 when Howard Aiken planned to develop a <b>machine</b> that could perform calculations involving large numbers has pass through a lot of stages such as the invention of <strike style="background-color:yellow;">punched cards</strike> to program patterns to create woven fabrics by mathematician Howard Aiken developed the Mark I calculating 
Harvard Mark I, an early protocomputer, built during World War II in the United States. While Vannevar Bush was working on analog computing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), across town
Harvard University professor Howard Aiken was working with digital devices for calculation.
 He had begun to realize in hardware something like the 19th-century English inventor Charles <p style="background-color:yellow;">Babbageâ€™s Analytical Engine, which he had read about. Starting in 1937, Aiken laid out detailed plans for a series of four calculating machines of increasing sophistication, based on different technologies, from the largely mechanical Mark I to the electronic Mark IV.</p>
